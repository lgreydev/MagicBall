# Magic Ball

Just shake your iPhone and you will get an answer. It `s Magic! Application receives random responses from free API. The application has two screens: Home and Settings. The Home screen contains the API response text. The Settings screen allows the user to add and save their answers (there is Demo Data). If there is no Internet connection or the request is not completed, the application displays one of the user's preprogrammed responses.

## Homework 1 📚

- If you don’t have **develop branch** in your repository, then create it from master

- Create **feature branch** and add **.gitignore** file - if you have one, then make some change in **Readme.md**

- Commit change and merge it into **develop** using Merge Request

- Create two more feature branches: in the first one modify **Readme.md** file, in the second one - delete it. Merge both of them into **develop** by resolving merge conflict.

- **Use only Terminal commands!**

- Add dependency using **Cocoapods** or **SPM** in your project. It may be anything you want: network library like **Alamofire**, spinner like **SVProgressHUD**, etc.
